# An Analysis of Red and White Wine Samples to Determine the Relationship Between Wine Attributes and Quality Ratings

## Overview

This project explores red and white wine samples to investigate how specific attributes influence wine quality ratings. By examining key characteristics—such as alcohol content, sugar levels, and acidity—this study aims to uncover patterns that may indicate which qualities are associated with higher-quality wines.

## Data Set

### 2.1 Source
The dataset offers a comprehensive overview of both red and white varieties of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine, focusing specifically on their physicochemical and sensory attributes. The physicochemical attributes include factors such as acidity, pH levels, alcohol content, and various other chemical compositions that affect the wine's quality and characteristics. The sensory attributes encompass aspects like aroma, taste, mouthfeel, and overall quality, assessed through expert sensory evaluation.

Due to privacy and logistical constraints, the dataset does not include certain details such as grape varieties, brand names, or pricing information. This omission allows for stricter confidentiality while still enabling researchers and wine enthusiasts to conduct in-depth analyses of the wines' inherent qualities. By centering on these specific attributes, the dataset facilitates a more focused understanding of the "Vinho Verde" wines' profiles, contributing to better wine-making practices and consumer education.

### 2.2 Attribute Information
The dataset includes the following attributes obtained from physicochemical tests:

**Input Variables**:
1. Fixed acidity
2. Volatile acidity
3. Citric acid
4. Residual sugar
5. Chlorides
6. Free sulfur dioxide
7. Total sulfur dioxide
8. Density
9. pH
10. Sulphates
11. Alcohol

**Output Variable**:
- **Quality**: A sensory-based score ranging from 0 to 10, representing the wine's quality.

## 3.0 Analytical Questions

In this study, we aim to explore the following key questions using the dataset:

1. Is one type of wine (red or white) generally associated with higher quality ratings?
2. Do wines with higher alcohol content tend to receive better quality scores?
3. Is there a correlation between sweetness, measured by residual sugar, and higher quality ratings?
4. What acidity levels are most commonly associated with the highest quality ratings?

This analysis will help identify patterns that contribute to a better understanding of the qualities of higher-rated wines.
